# ReverseGcodePerimeters
Reverses the perimeters generated by PrusaSlicer
This is a post-processing script for PrusaSlicer/ SuperSlicer.
Its intent is to print the perimeters from inwards instead of outwards, pushing the overextrusion towards the infill.

PrusaSlicer prints first the most inward perimeter first, then goes outwards. There is an option to print the outer perimeters first, but the inner ones will always be printed outwards that this software reverses.

The software support G0, G1, G2 and G3 moves. It keeps track of speed, acceleration and fan speed as well as some Prusaslicer metadata as ";TYPE","WIDTH;","HEIGHT" for proper visualisation in the GCode viewer.
